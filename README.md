Hello,
  I followed every instructions, I used Kotlin language, MVVM architecture, databinding, Hilt for Dependecy Injection, SharedPrefrences for saving data in activity 1(saved image into the cache memory, and saving the key into the sharedPref) and Room Database for Activity 2, as per the task I used Retrofit for the networking. I am attaching a small video of the app. I hope you like it.
